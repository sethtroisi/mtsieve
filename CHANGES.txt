2.1.0 - December 27, 2020
   framework:
      On Windows, switched to using gcc from msys2 instead of gcc from mingw64.  -O3
      gives a nice performance bump to some of the non-ASM code.
      
      Exit after showing help when using -h swtich instead of giving fatal error.
      
      Add logic to support validation of factors passed with -I, but not all sieves are
      coded to do this validation.
      
      On GPU builds, default -W to 0 and -G to 1.  A "special" CPU worker will be created
      as necessary to test ranges of p that are to small for the GPU code.
   
      For GPU executables, add -H to show some GPU details when each kernel is created.
   
      Improve factor rate calculation when using GPU workers.
      
      Created FUTURE.txt for items I would like to get working.
   
   cksieve:  version 1.3
      Added logic to validate factors passed with -I.

   gcwsieve, gcwsievecl:  version 1.4
      Added logic to validate factors passed with -I.
      Add -f option to gcwsieve so that it can generate ABC output that is supported by LLR.
      Added -M option and fixed -S for gcwsievecl.
      Improved speed of GPU code of gcwsievecl by about 25%.
      The GPU code is more than 20x faster than the CPU for the same amount of work.
   
   mfsieve, mfsievecl:  version 1.7
      Added logic to validate factors passed with -I.
      Replaced all ASM routines with non-ASM routines based upon Montgomery mulitplication.  This
      provides a speed bump of at least 30% over the previous release.
      Fixed the GPU code and replaced magic number logic with Montgomery multiplcation as it is
      faster.  The new GPU code is more then 25% faster than the old GPU code.
      The GPU code is more than 20x faster than the CPU for the same amount of work.
   
    sgsieve:  version 1.2
      Added logic to validate factors passed with -I.
      
    twinsieve:  version 1.3
      Added logic to validate factors passed with -I.
      
    xyyxsieve, xyyxsievecl:  version 1.8
      Added logic to validate factors passed with -I.
    
2.0.6 - September 8, 2020
   Fixed crash with xyyxsievecl with overly large ranges for the GPU.
   More speed enhancements for xyyxsieve, mainly due to reduced memory requirements.
   Do not show ETA or percent done if less than 1% done and -P not used.
   Modify factor rate calculation to handle uneven factor distribution better.
   Fix srsieve2 as it was counting factors of terms that had already been removed.
   
2.0.5 - July 13, 2020
   Added support for newpgen format to sgsieve.

2.0.4 - July 10, 2020
   Fixed an issue with factor rate calculation if all factors are found in the 
   first minute and none after.
   Added sgsieve for Sophie-Germain searches.

2.0.3 - June 13, 2020
   Fixed an issue where sieving would stop after rebuilding workers.

2.0.2 - June 8, 2020
   Ensure that -p always overrides "last prime" from input file.
   Fixed fkbnsieve as it can sometimes miss factors for small p.
   Fixed issues with k1b2sieve.
   Fixed ^C handling as sometimes sieving wouldn't stop.
   
2.0.1 - June 1, 2020
   Added k1b2sieve to sieve 2^n+c for a range of n and c.
   Fixed runtime issue with gcwsieve.
   
2.0.0 - May 20, 2020
   Fixed an issue with the framework where it could stop sieving before reaching the max
   prime specified on the command line.
   Fixed a link issue with gfndsieve and dmdsieve with GMP on OS X.
   Fixed a compiler issue with the .align ASM instruction on OS X.

1.9.8 - May 18, 2020
   Fixed issue in gfndsieve where it accesses memory beyond the bounds of a vector.
   
1.9.7 - January 15, 2020
   Fixed issue in srsieve2 where it crashes when starting a new sieve.
   Fixed issue in srsieve2 where it finds an invalid factor and terminates.
   
1.9.6 - January 10, 2020
   Refactored logic for "single worker" and "rebuild" logic so they work more nicely together.
   Fixed calculation of p/sec which is wrong after workers are recreated.
   Reset factor stats whenever workers are created as the rate is inflated for lower p as
   far more terms are removed.
   Fix issue with multiple threads which can cause program to hang.
   Add support for ABC format to srsieve2.
   
1.9.5 - August 19, 2019
   Fixed errors factor rate calculation.

1.9.4 - August 9, 2019
   Fix a segfault with srsieve2 when rebuilding subsequences.
   Fix a segfault with AVX logic on non-Windows OSes.
   Fixed an issue with gfndsieve and dmdsieve where a large range of k and small range of x
   cause it to not sieve subsequent subranges.
   Added a table to gfndsieve to pre-set pmax if using -x and -P is not specified.
   Add -D flag to xyyxsieve to disable AVX as it crashes in the AVX routines on Windows OS
   on AMD CPUs.  The flag will be removed when that issue is resolved.
   Added -fP to srsieve2.  This will generate a more verbose ABC output file with each line
   specificing the values of k, n, and c.  It will also add the number_primes switch which is
   supported by pfgw to ensure only a single prime for each distinct k of the file.
   Added -fB to srsieve2.  This will generate a format that can be used to load BOINC.  This
   is equivalent to the "PRP" format used by srsieve/srfile
   
1.9.3 - July 25, 2019
   Re-implemented a single makefile.  It will now build separate exes for OpenCL enabled binaries.
   Fix ABC format line in xyyxsieve output file.
   Adjust reported factoring rate to account for less than 1 full CPU or more than 1 full CPU.
   Handle race condition that can trigger an infinite loop.
   Allow the first chunk to be smaller so that a rebuild of terms can be triggered earlier.
   srsieve2 will compile, but requires more testing and only has srsieve functions.
   
1.9.2 - June 17, 2019
   Split makefile so only GPU-enabled code will compile and link with OpenCL libraries
   with intention of a single makefile in the future as having two nearly identical
   makefiles is difficult to maintain.
   Made changes to the framework to support sieving in chunks as needed by gfndsieve
   and dmdsieve. 
   Added -x and -X switches to gfndsieve.  With these switches one can execute Fermat
   divisibility checks after sieving.
   Allow gfndsieve to sieve smaller n, but report if k*2^n+1 is a prime in the range
   being sieved.  It will not report if k*2^n+1 is prime when k*2^n+1 > maxp, but less than maxp^2.
   Added -x and -X switches to dmdsieve.  With these switches one can execute MMP
   divisibility checks after sieving.

1.9.1 - May 31, 2019
   Added srsieve2, which will eventually replace srsieve, sr2sieve, and sr1sieve.  It has
   internal logic to determine how to sieve the input sequences, thus is combined into a
   single executable.  It does not support Legendre table logic from sr2sieve and sr1sieve,
   but should be faster than both when not using Legendre tables.
   If ib_BlockWhenProcessingFirstChunk is set to true for the sieve, the factor rate will now
   be reported if the first chunk requires more than 60 seconds to process.
   Sieves now report intermediate results when processing chunks.  This allows for more
   accurate factor rate calculations when it takes a long time to process each chunk.
   Continue to report status if sieving is done, but workers are still processing their chunk.

1.9.0 - May 21, 2019
   Changes were made to the framework to support srsieve2 (which isn't ready yet).  No other
   sieves use thse features (yet).
   Modify FactorApp in an effort to more accurately compute the factor rate.  When starting
   a new sieve, the factor rate would be inflated because it would calculate the rate based 
   upon all factors removed.  This change will exclude factors removed in the the first 30
   minutes that the program has run.  This logic will be executed when fewer than 60 terms
   have been removed in the previous hour.
   Fixed an issue in fbncsieve and twinsieve where the output file would contain composites
   that are divisible by p that had already been sieved.
   
1.8.5 - January 17, 2019
   Upgrade from primesieve 6.2 to primesieve 7.3.
   Change calculation of factor rate to be based upon CPU utilization instead of number of workers.
   Fix to twinsieve to correctly remove terms when using -r when restarting a sieve.

1.8.4 - December 23, 2018
   Added the new Mersenne Prime to dmdsieve.
   Fixed an issue in twinsieve and fbncsieve where it can exit with an error when
   testing primes above sqrt(max term).
   Fixed an issue (impacting all sieves) in computing the factor rate.  The issue will manifest itself by
   outputting a large factor removal rate.  It only occurs after running the sieve continuously for 5 days.
   
1.8.3 - October 7, 2018
   Added dmdsieve.  This is used to sieve for divisors of Double-Mersenne numbers.
   Output terms from dmdsieve have form 2*k*M+1 where M is a Mersenne Prime.

   Fixed twinsieve so that it properly handles input factor files.
   
1.8.2 - October 2, 2018
   Fixed twinsieve to properly check for file format when using -s.
   
1.8.1 - September 27, 2018
   Fixed a bug that causes all sieves to crash when trying to compute factor rate.
   twinsieve has duplicate -i switch, changed to -s.
   
1.8.0 - September 25, 2018
   Added twinsieve.  This is more than 3x faster than newpgen's twin sieve.

   Modified OpenCL code to change calculation for default workunits to improve GPU throughput.
   Modified "start sieving" message to include expected factors, but only if -P is not the default value.
   Modified all sieves to have custom "start sieving message" so it each show more detail specific to that sieve.
   
1.7.5 - August 14, 2018
   Fixed a crash when reading multiple empty lines in a row from an input file.
   Added -r option to fbncsieve to remove terms where k % base = 0.
   Various updates for newpgen output from fbncsieve:
       use the .npg extension instead of .pfgw extension
       change third parameter of first line to 1 for srsieve/srfile compatibility
       change last parameter of first line to 1/2 since 1/2 is used for fixed newpgen
       sieves and 257/258 are used for fixed k sieves.

   
1.7.4 - August 10, 2018
   Modify pixsieve to report primes.
   Modify pixsieve to output search string to console and log when sieve starts.
   Fixed a crash in xyyxsieve when sieving only one sign.
   Generate default filename for mfsieve if not specified on the command line.
   Fix issue in psieve if it finds a factor for the last term of the input.
   
   mfsieve supports AVX and is about 40% faster than previously.
   
1.7.3 - August 3, 2018
   Fixed a memory exception that affects GPU workers for all sieves.
   Re-enable AVX support with psieve as accidentally disabled in 1.7.1.
   Do not output factor rate if no factors found.
   Fixed another issue in non-AVX psieve code that causes it to crash.

1.7.2 - July 27, 2018
   Fixed issue with reading ABCD files as input lines with 1 character would be ignored.
   Fixed a crash upon exit of fbncsieve.
   Allow override with -p when starting fbncsieve and fkbnsieve from an input file.
   
1.7.1 - July 25, 2018
   Fixed output for number of terms remaaining to support values > 2^32.
   Modified psieve to support an input file created by fpsieve.
   Fixed a bug in the non-AVX primorial ASM code that causes it to crash.
   
1.7.0 - July 4, 2018
   Added a timestamp to lines written to the log.
   Changed usage of some registers in AVX code to avoid ymm0-ymm3 being passed
   between calls to AVX routines.
   Added psieve for primorials.
   
   psieve supports AVX and is about 30% faster than fpsieve.
   
1.6.0 - June 25, 2018
   Fixed an error with factor rate calculation when less than 1 per second.
   Fixed an issue with gfndsieve when continuing a sieve and k < n.
   For kbbsieve, added some checks for algebraic factorizations.
   Added gcwsieve for Cullens and Woodalls.  This sieve is GPU enabled.   
   Renamed all ASM routines to easily distinguish FPU/SSE/AVX.

   Added AVX asm code for use by the Worker classes.
   Added a mini-chunk mode that can be used when the worker classes
   handles primes in chunks, such as AVX mode, which is chunks of 16 primes.

   gcwsieve supports AVX.  The CPU-only code is about 30% faster than Geoff Reynold's version.
   xyyxsieve supports AVX.  The CPU-only code is about 2.5x faster than the previous version.
   
1.5.0 - April 10, 2018
   kbbsieve is more fully tested.  It now uses a powmod that is limited to
   52 bits (switching from extended floating point to SSE), which should be
   at least 10% faster.

1.4.0 - April 9, 2018
   Some common functionality for GPU sieving has been moved to Worker.cpp.
   All GPU workers validate factors found by the GPU.

   The xyyxsieve GPU sieving issue has been resolved.
   The pixsieve GPU sieving code has been tested.
   GPU sieving has been added to mfsieve.  It has been tested.
   GPU sieving has been added to gfndsieve.  It has been tested.
   
   Add kbbsieve, for the form k*b^b+/-1 for fixed k and variable b.  It has been
   partially tested.
   
1.3.0 - March 11, 2018
   Ensure that "ENABLE_GPU=no" in makefile builds all programs without error.
   cksieve no longer gives a fatal error if the computed root is not an actual
   root.  This condition rarely happens, but is okay when it does.
   Overriding -p from the command line should now work when starting with 
   an input file.
   
   Added GPU workers to xyyxsieve.  When using GPU workers, an overflow with
   collecting factors can cause xyyxsieve to crash.  If that happens override
   -S and/or -g or sieve more deeply with the CPU before adding GPU workers.
   This will be addressed in a future release.
   
   Added GPU workers to pixsieve.  It has not been tested yet.

1.2.0 - February 23, 2018
   fkbnsieve is now working.
   Modify cksieve to detect candidates that are prime and to log them.
   Fixed an asm bug that at worst causes factors to be missed by
   fbncsieve and gfndsieve.  It will nor result in invalid factors and
   if it did, they would be caught at runtime due to built-in factor
   checking that relies on completely different code.
   
   Added -A option to apply factors (or reformat candidate file) and
   exit immdiately without sieving.
   Added GPU classes.  This adds the following command line options:
      -D - to select the GPU platform
      -d - to select the GPU device
      -G - to specify the number of GPU workers
      -g - to set multiple of workgroupsize which is used to compute
           the number of primes per GPU worker
   Added GPU workers to afsieve.
   
1.1.0 - February 21, 2018
   Add an internal flag that guarantee that suspends all but one Worker when
   processing the first chunk of primes.  This is used to improve performance
   when there is a high factor density for low primes.  This will also suppress
   any on screen reporting or checkpointing until that chunk is processed.
   
   Fix issue in computing CPU utilization.
   Changed -c (chunksize) option to -w (worksize).
   Change output to use shorter notation for min and max primes.

   cksieve   - Fixed.
   gfndsieve - Enable the flag mentioned above.
   fbncsieve - Enable the flag mentioned above.
   fkbnsieve - Added, but not tested.
   
1.0.0 - February 10, 2018
   Initial Release
