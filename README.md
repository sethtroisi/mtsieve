# Seth's GIT based version of mtsieve

Rogue maintains the official copy at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtsieve/

To get the current version of mtsieve along with documentation for it and programs building upon it,
go to http://www.mersenneforum.org/rogue/mtsieve.html.

This repository was created in 2022-11 and it's unclear if I'll be able to continue to pull SVN changes.

It's mainly for some personal development work on core/HashTable and `sierpinski_riesel`.
